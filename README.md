# DC20 - Public Documentation
A place to host large images and knowledge sharing with the public.

---

We have internal tools for documentation, but some graphics was needed and we thought it a good oppurtunity to share it with the public. Might as well! Some people might find it interesting, fun or just helpful to get some insight into software development, and/or this project. The graphics here are produced in Figma (FigJam) and exported as .png so they can be displayed here.

### Brief Introduction
This application is a KMP project, that means it's a [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/kotlin-multiplatform/) codebase. KMP is a natural evolution where Jetbrains (the creators of IntelliJ, Kotlin and much more nerdy dev-stuff) made a new framework for making apps targeting all platforms. The framework uses [kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - which is originally a Java clone but much, MUCH, nicer and piggybacks on a lot of progress that have been made in the Android app community. That's because Andrid apps have always been written in Java and very shortly after it's conception Kotlin.

KMP is not 100% stable across all platforms and not all parts of how things should actually work are not perfectly figured out (or at least not officially communicated in an easy to reach channel); but - it works! So we can confidently construct our app and know that in the future support for Android, iOS, tablets, desktop, OSX, Windows, Linux and web will only become better and better. For instance in both web and desktop - sometimes the clicks are shown but not registered! I'm not sure why, but I won't bother investigating and hope that the foundational stability will be improved in the future and fix it for us.

# This App
In this github repo you'll find a collection of documenting graphics that will aid onboard our (new) developers and understand some concepts regarding naming, data models and KMP/Android conventions. It will not teach anyone how to do KMP or actually develop - but hopefully aid anyone trying to understand what Nik have been up to!
